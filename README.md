# Strava Mapper
*This is a project I worked on in March 2019 to learn the basic ideas of using APIs, AWS Lambda, AWS DynamoDB, and Flask in one combined project. It's still a work in progress.*

Strava Mapper is a web app deployed on AWS Lambda that maps out all of your previously run Strava workout routes on a single Google map.
